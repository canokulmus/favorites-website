    <h1>The Godfather</h1>
   
    <p>The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy,
        based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders
        of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the
        patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant
        family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.
